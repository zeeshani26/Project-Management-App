# Project-Management-App

The Project Management Dashboard aims to create a scalable, cloud-based application using Next.js, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, deployed on AWS. The primary objective is to enhance cloud computing skills while gaining hands-on experience with AWS deployment and security.

The project will feature a secure authentication system, task management capabilities, and collaboration tools, allowing users to create, assign, and track tasks. A dashboard with analytics will provide insights into project progress and task statuses. AWS services will be utilized for hosting, scalability, and security.

Research for this project includes studying platforms like Trello, Asana, and Jira to understand their key functionalities. Official documentation for Next.js, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and AWS will guide implementation.

The development process will involve building the front end with Next.js for a dynamic user interface, implementing a backend with Node.js and Express for API handling, and using PostgreSQL for efficient data management. AWS deployment will ensure scalability and security.

By completing this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of cloud-based application development, improve my full-stack development skills, and explore ways to optimize performance and security in a cloud environment. Future enhancements may include additional integrations, automation features, and advanced analytics.
